# Fix GitHub Push Protection Issue

GitHub detected your personal access token in the code and blocked the push for security.

## Option 1: Allow the Secret (Quick Fix)

1. Open this URL in browser:
   ```
   https://github.com/SAZZAD-404/Toolkit-Generator/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34qaiVW3DKsJkjXb3UwHGeyPDSS
   ```

2. Click "Allow secret" button

3. Run push again:
   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

## Option 2: Revoke & Create New Token (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Find your token `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`
3. Click "Delete" to revoke it
4. Create a new token
5. Update `.env` file with new token:
   ```
   VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_new_token_here
   ```
6. Push again

## Current Status

Your code is ready to push, but GitHub is protecting you from accidentally exposing your token.

The token is now safely stored in `.env` file (which is gitignored), but the old commits still contain it in history.

Choose Option 1 for quick fix, or Option 2 for better security.
